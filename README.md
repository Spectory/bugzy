# Bugzy - The worst app ever...

### Bug ideas

Server:

- [some things can be found here](https://github.com/Spectory/sql_dev#best-practices)
- Blocking first render to fetch data.
- Loading unused data/assets
- no assets caching.

Client

- [Rendering Performance](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/)
- rendering large images
- above the fold
- chaining AJAX calls instead of Promise.all
